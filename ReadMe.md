Brief overview of the project's focus: Exploring car market trends through EDA.

Importance of understanding factors influencing car prices based on brand, model, and other attributes.

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Source of the dataset (e.g., website, database).
    - Explanation of the features: price, brand_model, year, condition, body, fuel, location.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates.
    - Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
3. **Initial Exploration**:
    - Overview of dataset size and structure.
    - Basic statistics of numerical features (price, year) and categorical features (condition, fuel, etc.).
4. **Price Distribution**:
    - Visualizing the distribution of car prices using histograms or density plots.
    - Identifying potential outliers and extreme values.
5. **Temporal Analysis**:
    - Analyzing car price trends over different years.
    - Investigating how car prices have changed over time.
6. **Condition and Price**:
    - Exploring how car condition affects its price.
    - Comparing prices for different condition categories.

1. **Body Type and Fuel**:
    - Examining the relationship between car body type and price.
    - Analyzing price differences based on fuel type (petrol, diesel, etc.).
2. **Geographical Insights**:
    - Mapping car distribution across different locations.
    - Discovering regional price variations and potential drivers.
3. **Brand and Model Analysis**:
    - Identifying popular car brands and models in the dataset.
    - Investigating the price range for each brand and model.

1. **Correlation Exploration**:
    - Calculating correlations between numeric features (price, year, etc.).
    - Uncovering relationships that impact car prices.
2. **Visualization**:
    - Creating insightful visual representations like scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
    - Presenting findings in a clear and compelling manner.
